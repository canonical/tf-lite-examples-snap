# TensorFlow Lite example snaps

This repository contains a number of example snaps to show how to run machine learning workloads inside a snap package.

## [Image Labelling](image-labelling)

A bare bones Python script which takes an image file as input and prints out labels for it to the console.
If you are new to snapping software, this is a good place to start.
This example is accompanied by our blog post which you can read [here](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ai-inference-on-edge-with-tensorflow-lite).

## [Upstream Examples](upstream-examples)

A snap bundling the [TensorFlow Lite examples](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples) for the Raspberry Pi.

## [Ubuntu Frame](ubuntu-frame)

A slightly more advanced example showing how a production machine learning workload can run on Ubuntu Core with Ubuntu Frame.
